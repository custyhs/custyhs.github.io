Hi! My name is Yu Chen (陈禹 in Chinese).

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html). 


Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor's degree of Science from Tsinghua University in Mathematics.
