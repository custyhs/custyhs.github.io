Hi! My name is Yu Chen (陈禹 in Chinese).

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html). 


I had the great opportunity to work as a research intern at [MSR Asia Theory Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msr-asia-theory-center/publications/) from February to August 2024, under the guidance of [Dr. Wei Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/weic/).

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor's degree of Science from Tsinghua University in Mathematics.

## Research Interest
My research interests lie broadly in understanding the modern machine learning, with a recent focus on reinforcement learning and bandits theory. I am very open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat!
