Hello! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), Tsinghua University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/index.html). 

Prior to that, I graduated from the Department of Mathematics, Tsinghua in June 2023 and earned my Bachelor's degree of science.
